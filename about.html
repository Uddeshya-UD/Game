        <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 4, 2019, without any prior announcement or marketing. The game is currently in its fourth season.</p>
        <p>In Apex Legends, up to 20 three-man squads land on an island before searching for weapons and supplies to then attempt to defeat all other players in combat. Each player must also keep moving to avoid being caught outside the play area. The final team alive wins the round. The game is set in the same sci-fi universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall and Titanfall 2.</p>
